# Leetcode Practitioner

This is a template for creating documentation with [Nextra](https://nextra.site).

## Getting Started

Welcome to the documentation website for my LeetCode practices repository! This website serves as a companion to the main repository and providing detailed explanations for the solutions to the problems contained within.

I hope that this website will be a valuable resource for those looking to improve their coding skills and prepare for technical interviews. Happy coding!"
