## Problem

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

## Solution

You can implement a solution to check if a given 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid by following these steps:

1. Create three sets, one for rows, one for columns, and one for sub-boxes.
2. Iterate over each cell of the board. If the cell is not empty, check if the number is already in the corresponding row set, column set, and sub-box set. If it is, return false. Otherwise, add the number to the sets.
3. After iterating over all cells, return true.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of cells in the board, because we need to iterate over each cell and check the corresponding sets. The space complexity is O(n), because we are using three sets of size n to store the numbers in the rows, columns, and sub-boxes.

Here is the implementation code in JavaScript:

```javascript
function isValidSudoku(board) {
    const rows = new Array(9).fill("").map(() => new Set());
    const cols = new Array(9).fill("").map(() => new Set());
    const boxes = new Array(9).fill("").map(() => new Set());
    for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] === '.') continue;
            const num = board[i][j];
            const boxIdx = Math.floor(i / 3) * 3 + Math.floor(j / 3);
            if (rows[i].has(num) || cols[j].has(num) || boxes[boxIdx].has(num)) return false;
            rows[i].add(num);
            cols[j].add(num);
            boxes[boxIdx].add(num);
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
