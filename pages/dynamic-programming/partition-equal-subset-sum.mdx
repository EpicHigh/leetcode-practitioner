## Problem

Given a non-empty array nums containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

## Example

Input: nums = [1, 5, 11, 5]

Output: true

Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 5]

Output: false

Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.

## Summary

To solve this problem, we first calculate the total sum of the array elements. If the total sum is odd, we return false because it is not possible to divide an odd number equally between two subsets. If the total sum is even, we can continue with our solution.

We create a 1-dimensional boolean array dp of length target + 1, where target is half of the total sum. We initialize dp[0] to true. This DP array will help us keep track of whether it's possible to form a subset with a given sum.

We iterate through each element in nums. For each number, we update our DP array by iterating from target down to the current number. In each iteration, we update the DP value at index j by using the logical OR operation on the current DP value at index j and the DP value at index j - num. This update step helps us determine if it's possible to form a subset with a sum of j including the current number.

After processing all elements, we return the boolean value at dp[target], which indicates if it's possible to form a subset with a sum equal to the target.

## Solution

### In TypeScript

```typescript
function canPartition(nums: number[]): boolean {
    const total = nums.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
    if (total % 2 !== 0) return false;

    const target = total / 2;
    const dp: boolean[] = Array(target + 1).fill(false);

    dp[0] = true;

    for (const num of nums) {
        for (let j = target; j >= num; j--) {
            dp[j] = dp[j] || dp[j - num];
        }
    }

    return dp[target];
}
```

### In Python

```python
def canPartition(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
		total = sum(nums)
		if total % 2 != 0:
				return False

		target = total // 2
		dp = [False] * (target + 1)
		dp[0] = True

		for num in nums:
				for j in range(target, num - 1, -1):
						dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - num]

		return dp[target]
```

## Step-by-step explanation

1. Calculate the total sum of the elements in the input array `nums` using the `reduce()` method. If the total sum is odd, return `false`, because it's impossible to divide an odd number equally between two subsets.

```typescript
const total = nums.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
if (total % 2 !== 0) return false;
```

2. Calculate the target sum, which is half of the total sum. Create a boolean DP (dynamic programming) array `dp` of length `target + 1`. Initialize the first element `dp[0]` to `true`, as it's always possible to form a subset with a sum of 0.

```typescript
const target = total / 2;
const dp: boolean[] = Array(target + 1).fill(false);
dp[0] = true;
```

3. Iterate through each element in the input array `nums`.

```typescript
for (const num of nums) {
		// ...
}
```

4. For each number in `nums`, update the DP array by iterating from `target` down to the current number. In each iteration, update the DP value at index `j` by using the logical OR operation on the current DP value at index `j` and the DP value at index `j - num`. This step helps determine if it's possible to form a subset with a sum of `j` including the current number.

```typescript
for (let j = target; j >= num; j--) {
		dp[j] = dp[j] || dp[j - num];
}
```

5. After processing all elements, return the boolean value at `dp[target]`, which indicates if it's possible to form a subset with a sum equal to the target.

```typescript
return dp[target];
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * target), where n is the length of the input array and target is half of the total sum of the array elements. This remains the same as the previous solution.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is now reduced to O(target) due to the 1D DP array, making it more space-efficient compared to the previous solution.
