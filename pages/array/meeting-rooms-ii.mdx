## Problem

Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times `[[s1, e1], [s2, e2], ...]`, find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

## Example

Input: intervals = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]

Output: 2

## Summary

To solve this problem, we can sort the intervals based on their start times. Then we can use a min-heap to keep track of the meeting end times of active meetings. By iterating through the sorted intervals, we can compare the start time of the current meeting with the end time of the earliest ending meeting. If there is a room available, we can update the end time; otherwise, we need to add a new meeting room.

## Solution

### In TypeScript

```typescript
function minMeetingRooms(intervals: number[][]): number {
	if (intervals.length === 0) {
		return 0;
	}

	intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
	const minHeap: number[] = [intervals[0][1]];

	for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
		const [start, end] = intervals[i];

		if (start >= minHeap[0]) {
			minHeap.shift();
		}

		minHeap.push(end);
		minHeap.sort((a, b) => a - b);
	}

	return minHeap.length;
}
```

### In Python

```python
import heapq

def minMeetingRooms(intervals):
		if len(intervals) == 0:
				return 0

		intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
		min_heap = [intervals[0][1]]

		for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
				start, end = intervals[i]

				if start >= min_heap[0]:
						heapq.heappop(min_heap)

				heapq.heappush(min_heap, end)

		return len(min_heap)
```

## Step-by-step explanation

1. First, check if the intervals array is empty. If it is, return 0 because no meeting rooms are needed.

```typescript
if (intervals.length === 0) {
	return 0;
}
```

2. Sort the input array `intervals` based on their start times using the `sort()` method. This will help us process the meetings in chronological order.

```typescript
intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
```

3. Initialize a min-heap `minHeap` that will store the end times of the active meetings. Initially, add the end time of the first meeting to the min-heap.

```typescript
const minHeap: number[] = [intervals[0][1]];
```

4. Iterate through the sorted intervals array starting from the second interval (i = 1). For each interval, destructure its `start` and `end` times into start and end variables.

```typescript
for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
	const [start, end] = intervals[i];
}
```

5. Check if the start time of the current interval is greater than or equal to the end time of the earliest ending meeting (i.e., the first element in the min-heap). If so, remove the earliest ending meeting from the min-heap using `shift()`, as this meeting room is now available for the current meeting.

```typescript
if (start >= minHeap[0]) {
	minHeap.shift();
}
```

6. Add the end time of the current meeting to the min-heap. Then, sort the min-heap to maintain its structure.

```typescript
minHeap.push(end);
minHeap.sort((a, b) => a - b);
```

7. After processing all intervals, the length of the min-heap represents the minimum number of meeting rooms required. Return this value.

```typescript
return minHeap.length;
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * log(n)), where n is the length of the input array. Sorting the intervals takes O(n * log(n)) time, and inserting the end times into the min-heap takes O(n * log(n)) time in the worst case.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(n) because we are storing the meeting end times in the min-heap. In the worst case, the min-heap will store n entries, where n is the length of the input array.
