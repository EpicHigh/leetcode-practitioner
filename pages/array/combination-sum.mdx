## Problem

Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

## Example

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]

## Summary

To solve this problem, we need to find all unique combinations of numbers in the input array candidates that sum up to the target number target. We can solve this problem recursively by iterating through the input array, selecting each element as a potential starting point for a combination, and then recursing on the remaining part of the input array to find all valid combinations that add up to the remaining target.

To avoid duplicates, we can start each recursive call from the current index instead of the beginning of the input array. We can also keep track of the current sum and stop recursing once the sum is greater than the target. Finally, we can add the valid combinations to a results array and return it.

## Solution

### In TypeScript

```typescript
function combinationSum(candidates: number[], target: number): number[][] {
	const results: number[][] = [];

	function backtrack(current: number[], sum: number, start: number) {
		if (sum > target) {
			return;
		}
		if (sum === target) {
			results.push(current.slice());
			return;
		}

		for (let i = start; i < candidates.length; i++) {
			current.push(candidates[i]);
			backtrack(current, sum + candidates[i], i);
			current.pop();
		}
	}

	backtrack([], 0, 0);
	return results;
}
```

### In Python

```python
def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
	results = []

	def backtrack(current, sum, start):
		if sum > target:
			return
		if sum == target:
			results.append(current[:])
			return

		for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
			current.append(candidates[i])
			backtrack(current, sum + candidates[i], i)
			current.pop()

	backtrack([], 0, 0)
	return results
```

## Step-by-step explanation

1. An empty 2D array result is created to hold the final combinations.

```typescript
const results: number[][] = [];
```

2. The function backtrack is defined to recursively search for all valid combinations that add up to the target sum.

```typescript
function backtrack(current: number[], sum: number, start: number) {
	// ...
}
```

3. The function backtrack takes three parameters: current represents the current combination being built, sum represents the current sum of the elements in current, and start represents the index to start searching for new elements in the input array.
4. If the current sum is greater than the target, the function returns and does not consider the current combination any further.

```typescript
if (sum > target) {
	return;
}
```

5. If the current sum is equal to the target, the current combination is a valid solution and is added to the results array.

```typescript
if (sum === target) {
	results.push(current.slice());
	return;
}
```

6. Otherwise, the function iterates over the remaining elements in the input array starting from the start index.

```typescript
for (let i = start; i < candidates.length; i++) {
	// ...
}
```

7. For each element, it adds it to the current combination, recursively calls the backtrack function with the updated combination and sum, and then removes the added element to restore the previous state.

```typescript
current.push(candidates[i]);
```

8. This process continues until all possible combinations have been explored.
9. Finally, the backtrack function is called with an empty combination, a sum of 0, and a start index of 0 to initiate the search.

```typescript
backtrack([], 0, 0);
```

10. The function returns the results array, which contains all valid combinations that add up to the target sum.

```typescript
return results;
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is exponential, as we may potentially explore all combinations of the input array. However, the actual runtime will depend on the structure of the input array and the target value. In practice, the algorithm is often able to prune large portions of the search tree early and terminate quickly.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is also exponential, as we may potentially generate a large number of combinations. However, the space required for each recursive call is proportional to the depth of the recursion, which is limited by the size of the input array. Thus, the actual space usage will depend on the structure of the input array and the target value. In practice, the algorithm is often able to prune large portions of the search tree early and use less space.
