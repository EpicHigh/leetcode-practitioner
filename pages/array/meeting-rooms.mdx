## Problem

Given an array of meeting time intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], determine if a person could attend all meetings.

## Example

Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]

Output: false

Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]

Output: true

## Summary

This problem requires us to determine whether there exists any overlapping meeting intervals. We can solve this problem by sorting the intervals by their start times, and then checking if any adjacent intervals overlap.

## Solution

### In TypeScript

```typescript
function canAttendMeetings(intervals: number[][]): boolean {
    // Sort intervals by start time
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    // Check if any adjacent intervals overlap
    for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### In Python

```python
def canAttendMeetings(intervals: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    # Sort intervals by start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    # Check if any adjacent intervals overlap
    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
        if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]:
            return False

    return True
```

## Step-by-step explanation

1. We sort the intervals array by their start times in ascending order using the built-in sort function and a comparison function that compares the first element of each interval.

```typescript
intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
```

2. We iterate over the sorted intervals array using a for loop starting at the second element (index 1) since we will be comparing each interval with the previous one. For each iteration, we check if the start time of the current interval is less than the end time of the previous interval. If it is, then the current and previous intervals overlap, and we immediately return false since the person cannot attend all meetings without overlapping.

```typescript
for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
		if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]) {
				return false;
		}
}
```

3. If we reach the end of the loop without returning false, it means that there are no overlapping intervals, and the person can attend all meetings without overlapping. In this case, we return true.

```typescript
return true;
```

Overall, the solution is efficient and easy to follow since it involves only a single loop and a sort function. The time complexity is O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals, due to the sorting step, and the space complexity is O(1), since we are only using constant extra space.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals. The sorting step takes O(n log n) time, and the loop over the intervals takes O(n) time.

### Space

The space complexity of this solution is O(1) because we are only using constant extra space to store variables for the loop.

## Variations

There are actually several different algorithms that can be used to solve this problem, each with its own time and space complexity. Here are a few variations:

### Brute Force

One possible solution is to compare every possible pair of intervals and check if any of them overlap. This approach would require a nested loop and result in a time complexity of O(n^2). The space complexity would be O(1) since no additional data structure is required.

#### In TypeScript

```typescript
function canAttendMeetings(intervals: number[][]): boolean {
    for (let i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < intervals.length; j++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] < intervals[j][1] && intervals[j][0] < intervals[i][1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

#### In Python

```python
def canAttendMeetings(intervals: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
		for i in range(len(intervals)):
				for j in range(i + 1, len(intervals)):
						if intervals[i][0] < intervals[j][1] and intervals[j][0] < intervals[i][1]:
								return False
		return True
```

In this solution, we have two nested loops that iterate over every possible pair of intervals. For each pair, we check if the start time of the first interval is less than the end time of the second interval AND the start time of the second interval is less than the end time of the first interval. If this condition is true, it means that the two intervals overlap, and we immediately return false since the person cannot attend all meetings without overlapping.

### Sorting

As demonstrated in the solution above, we can sort the intervals by start time and then compare adjacent intervals to check for overlap. This approach requires sorting the intervals, which has a time complexity of O(n log n), and then iterating over the intervals, which has a time complexity of O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n). The space complexity is O(1) since we only need to store a few variables to keep track of the current and previous intervals.

### Interval Tree

Another approach is to use an interval tree data structure to store the intervals and efficiently query for overlapping intervals. Building an interval tree has a time complexity of O(n log n), and querying the tree for overlapping intervals has a time complexity of O(log n) for each query. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n). The space complexity is O(n) since we need to store the intervals in the tree.

#### In TypeScript

```typescript
class IntervalTreeNode {
    start: number;
    end: number;
    left: IntervalTreeNode | null;
    right: IntervalTreeNode | null;
    constructor(start: number, end: number) {
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

class IntervalTree {
    root: IntervalTreeNode | null;
    constructor() {
        this.root = null;
    }

    // Insert a new interval into the tree
    insert(start: number, end: number) {
        const newNode = new IntervalTreeNode(start, end);
        if (!this.root) {
            this.root = newNode;
            return;
        }
        let curr = this.root;
        while (true) {
            if (start < curr.start) {
                if (!curr.left) {
                    curr.left = newNode;
                    break;
                }
                curr = curr.left;
            } else {
                if (!curr.right) {
                    curr.right = newNode;
                    break;
                }
                curr = curr.right;
            }
        }
    }

    // Check if any intervals in the tree overlap with the given interval
    overlaps(start: number, end: number): boolean {
        let curr = this.root;
        while (curr) {
            if (end <= curr.start) {
                curr = curr.left;
            } else if (start >= curr.end) {
                curr = curr.right;
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

function canAttendMeetings(intervals: number[][]): boolean {
    const tree = new IntervalTree();
    for (let i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        const [start, end] = intervals[i];
        if (tree.overlaps(start, end)) {
            return false;
        }
        tree.insert(start, end);
    }
    return true;
}
```

#### In Python

```python
class IntervalTreeNode:
    def __init__(self, start: int, end: int):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class IntervalTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None

    # Insert a new interval into the tree
    def insert(self, start: int, end: int):
        new_node = IntervalTreeNode(start, end)
        if not self.root:
            self.root = new_node
            return
        curr = self.root
        while True:
            if start < curr.start:
                if not curr.left:
                    curr.left = new_node
                    break
                curr = curr.left
            else:
                if not curr.right:
                    curr.right = new_node
                    break
                curr = curr.right

    # Check if any intervals in the tree overlap with the given interval
    def overlaps(self, start: int, end: int) -> bool:
        curr = self.root
        while curr:
            if end <= curr.start:
                curr = curr.left
            elif start >= curr.end:
                curr = curr.right
            else:
                return True
        return False

def canAttendMeetings(intervals: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    tree = IntervalTree()
    for interval in intervals:
        start, end = interval
        if tree.overlaps(start, end):
            return False
        tree.insert(start, end)
    return True
```

In this solution, we define two classes: IntervalTreeNode and IntervalTree. IntervalTreeNode represents a single node in the interval tree and contains the start and end times of an interval, as well as pointers to its left and right child nodes. IntervalTree represents the interval tree itself and provides methods to insert new intervals into the tree and check if any intervals overlap with a given interval.

The `canAttendMeetings` function first creates an empty interval tree. Then, for each interval in the input, it checks if the interval overlaps with any intervals in the tree using the overlaps method. If an overlap is found, it immediately returns false. Otherwise, it inserts the interval into the tree using the insert method. If we reach the end of the loop without returning false, it means that there are no overlapping intervals, and the person can attend all meetings without overlapping.

### Sweep Line Algorithm

The sweep line algorithm is another approach that can be used to solve the Meeting Rooms problem. The idea is to maintain a "sweep line" that moves from left to right across the intervals, and use an event queue to keep track of the start and end times of the intervals. As the sweep line moves, we can check for overlapping intervals using a data structure like a priority queue or a binary search tree. The time complexity of this approach is also O(n log n), and the space complexity is O(n) for the event queue and any additional data structures used for checking overlaps.

#### In TypeScript

```typescript
function canAttendMeetings(intervals: number[][]): boolean {
    // Create an array to store events
    const events: [number, boolean][] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        const [start, end] = intervals[i];
        // Add start and end events to the events array
        events.push([start, true]);
        events.push([end, false]);
    }
    // Sort the events array by time
    events.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    // Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of overlapping intervals
    let overlaps = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < events.length; i++) {
        const [time, isStart] = events[i];
        // If this is a start event, increment the overlaps counter
        if (isStart) {
            overlaps++;
            // If there are more than one overlapping intervals, return false
            if (overlaps > 1) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        // If this is an end event, decrement the overlaps counter
        else {
            overlaps--;
        }
    }
    // If we reach the end of the loop without returning false, return true
    return true;
}
```

#### In Python

```python
def canAttendMeetings(intervals: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
		# Create an array to store events
		events = []
		for interval in intervals:
				start, end = interval
				# Add start and end events to the events array
				events.append((start, True))
				events.append((end, False))
		# Sort the events array by time
		events.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

		# Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of overlapping intervals
		overlaps = 0
		for event in events:
				time, is_start = event
				# If this is a start event, increment the overlaps counter
				if is_start:
						overlaps += 1
						# If there are more than one overlapping intervals, return false
						if overlaps > 1:
								return False
				# If this is an end event, decrement the overlaps counter
				else:
						overlaps -= 1
		# If we reach the end of the loop without returning false, return true
		return True
```

In this solution, we use an array to store events that represent the start and end times of intervals. We iterate over the input array and add start and end events to the events array. Then, we sort the events array by time using the built-in sort function and a comparison function that compares the first element of each event.

We then initialize a variable to keep track of the number of overlapping intervals and iterate over the events array. For each event, we check if it is a start event or an end event. If it is a start event, we increment the overlaps counter and check if there are more than one overlapping intervals. If there are, we immediately return false since the person cannot attend all meetings without overlapping. If it is an end event, we decrement the overlaps counter.

If we reach the end of the loop without returning false, it means that there are no overlapping intervals, and the person can attend all meetings without overlapping. In this case, we return true.
