## Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals `k`.

## Example

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2

Output: 2

## Summary

To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to store the cumulative sums and their counts as we iterate through the array. For each element, we can calculate the cumulative sum up to that element and check if there is a cumulative sum that, if subtracted from the current sum, would result in the target sum `k`. If so, we increment our subarray count. We can return the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals `k` at the end.

## Solution

### In TypeScript

```typescript
function subarraySum(nums: number[], k: number): number {
	const sums = new Map<number, number>();
	sums.set(0, 1);
	let count = 0;
	let sum = 0;

	for (const num of nums) {
		sum += num;

		if (sums.has(sum - k)) {
			count += sums.get(sum - k) || 0;
		}

		sums.set(sum, (sums.get(sum) || 0) + 1);
	}

	return count;
}
```

### In Python

```python
def subarraySum(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
	sums = {0: 1}
	count = 0
	sum = 0

	for num in nums:
		sum += num

		if sum - k in sums:
			count += sums[sum - k]

		sums[sum] = sums.get(sum, 0) + 1

	return count
```

## Step-by-step explanation

1. Initialize the `sums` hashmap with a key of `0` and a value of `1`. This is because a sum of 0 has been "seen" once before starting the iteration.

```typescript
const sums = new Map<number, number>();
sums.set(0, 1);
```

2. Initialize the `count` and `sum` variables to 0. The `count` variable will store the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals `k`, while `sum` will store the cumulative sum up to the current element during the iteration.

```typescript
let count = 0;
let sum = 0;
```

3. Iterate through the `nums` array.

```typescript
for (const num of nums) {
	// ...
}
```

4. Update the cumulative sum by adding the current element's value.

```typescript
sum += num;
```

5. Check if there is a cumulative sum in the `sums` hashmap that, if subtracted from the current sum, would result in the target sum `k`. If so, increment the `count` by the number of occurrences of the required sum difference.

```typescript
if (sums.has(sum - k)) {
	count += sums.get(sum - k) || 0;
}
```

6. Update the `sums` hashmap by incrementing the count of the current cumulative sum. If the current sum is not in the hashmap, it initializes the count to 1.

```typescript
sums.set(sum, (sums.get(sum) || 0) + 1);
```

7. After iterating through the entire array, return the `count` variable, which stores the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals `k`.

```typescript
return count;
```

In summary, this solution calculates the cumulative sums while iterating through the input array and stores the counts of each sum in a hashmap. For each element, it checks if there is a sum in the hashmap that can result in the target sum `k` when subtracted from the current cumulative sum. If so, it increments the subarray count accordingly. The final `count` variable contains the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals `k`.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We iterate through the input array once, updating the cumulative sum and checking if there's a valid sum to reach the target `k`.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), as we are storing the cumulative sums and their counts in a hashmap. In the worst case, the hashmap will store n entries, where n is the length of the input array.
