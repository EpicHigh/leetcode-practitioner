## Problem

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

## Example

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], k = 3

Output: [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]

## Summary

To solve this problem, we can use an in-place approach to rotate the array. First, we reverse the whole array, then reverse the first k elements, and finally, reverse the remaining elements. This way, we obtain the rotated array.

## Solution

### In TypeScript

```typescript
function rotate(nums: number[], k: number): void {
  k = k % nums.length;
  reverse(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
  reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
  reverse(nums, k, nums.length - 1);
}

function reverse(nums: number[], start: number, end: number): void {
  while (start < end) {
    [nums[start], nums[end]] = [nums[end], nums[start]];
    start++;
    end--;
  }
}
```

### In Python

```python
def rotate(nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
	k = k % len(nums)
	reverse(nums, 0, len(nums) - 1)
	reverse(nums, 0, k - 1)
	reverse(nums, k, len(nums) - 1)

def reverse(nums: List[int], start: int, end: int) -> None:
	while start < end:
		nums[start], nums[end] = nums[end], nums[start]
		start += 1
		end -= 1
```

## Step-by-step explanation

1. Calculate the remainder when `k` is divided by `nums.length`. This is necessary because if `k` is larger than the array length, the effective number of rotations will be the remainder of the division.

```typescript
k = k % nums.length;
```

2. Reverse the entire array by calling the `reverse` helper function with the start index as 0 and the end index as `nums.length - 1`.

```typescript
reverse(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
```

3. Reverse the first `k` elements of the array by calling the `reverse` helper function with the start index as 0 and the end index as `k - 1`.

```typescript
reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
```

4. Reverse the remaining elements in the array, which are from index `k` to `nums.length - 1`, by calling the `reverse` helper function with the start index as k and the end index as `nums.length - 1`.

```typescript
reverse(nums, k, nums.length - 1);
```

5. Define the `reverse` helper function, which takes the `nums` array, a start index, and an end index as its input parameters. The purpose of this function is to reverse the elements within the specified range of the input array.

```typescript
function reverse(nums: number[], start: number, end: number): void {
	// ...
}
```

6. Inside the `reverse` function, use a `while` loop to iterate through the elements within the specified range. The loop should continue as long as the start index is less than the end index.

```typescript
while (start < end) {
	// ...
}
```

7. In each iteration, use array destructuring to swap the elements at the start and end indices.

```typescript
[nums[start], nums[end]] = [nums[end], nums[start]];
```

8. Increment the start index and decrement the end index to move towards the middle of the specified range.

```typescript
start++;
end--;
```

In summary, the solution provided rotates the array to the right by reversing the entire array, reversing the first k elements, and then reversing the remaining elements. The time complexity is O(n) as each element is reversed once, and the space complexity is O(1) since the operation is performed in-place.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. Each element in the array is reversed exactly once (in three different steps), which results in linear time complexity.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(1) because we perform the rotation in-place, without using any additional data structures.
