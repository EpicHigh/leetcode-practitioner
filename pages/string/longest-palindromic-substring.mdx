## Problem

Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

## Example

Input: s = "babad"

Output: "bab"

Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

## Summary

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input string, and for each character, expand around it to find the longest palindromic substring that includes it. We will do this for both even and odd length palindromes. We will keep track of the start and end indices of the longest palindrome found so far.

## Solution

### In TypeScript

```typescript
function longestPalindrome(s: string): string {
	let start = 0;
	let end = 0;

	for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
		const len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i);
		const len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1);
		const len = Math.max(len1, len2);

		if (len > end - start) {
			start = i - Math.floor((len - 1) / 2);
			end = i + Math.floor(len / 2);
		}
	}

	return s.substring(start, end + 1);
}

function expandAroundCenter(s: string, left: number, right: number): number {
	while (left >= 0 && right < s.length && s[left] === s[right]) {
		left--;
		right++;
	}

	return right - left - 1;
}
```

### In Python

```python
def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
		start = 0
		end = 0

		for i in range(len(s)):
				len1 = self.expandAroundCenter(s, i, i)
				len2 = self.expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1)
				length = max(len1, len2)

				if length > end - start:
						start = i - (length - 1) // 2
						end = i + length // 2

		return s[start:end + 1]

def expandAroundCenter(self, s: str, left: int, right: int) -> int:
		while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
				left -= 1
				right += 1

		return right - left - 1
```

## Step-by-step explanation

1. Initialize two variables `start` and `end` to store the indices of the longest palindrome found so far.

```typescript
let start = 0;
let end = 0;
```

2. Iterate through the input string `s` with a `for` loop, using variable `i` as the index. For each character at index `i` in the string, we will try to expand around it to find the longest palindromic substring that includes it.

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
	// ...
}
```

3. Call the `expandAroundCenter` function twice for each character, once for odd-length palindromes and once for even-length palindromes. We pass `i` as the center for odd-length palindromes and `i + 1` for even-length palindromes.

```typescript
const len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i);
const len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1);
```

4. The `expandAroundCenter` function returns the length of the longest palindrome found when expanding around the given center(s). We take the maximum of the two returned lengths (odd and even cases) as the actual length of the longest palindrome for the current character.

```typescript
const len = Math.max(len1, len2);
```

5. If the length of the palindrome found is greater than the length of the previously found longest palindrome (tracked using the `start` and `end` variables), update the `start` and `end` variables to represent the new longest palindrome.

```typescript
if (len > end - start) {
		start = i - Math.floor((len - 1) / 2);
		end = i + Math.floor(len / 2);
}
```

6. After the loop finishes, we return the longest palindromic substring using `s.substring(start, end + 1)`.

```typescript
return s.substring(start, end + 1);
```

7. The `expandAroundCenter` function is a helper function that takes the string `s` and two indices, `left` and `right`, as input. It tries to expand around the center of the palindrome, checking if the characters at `left` and `right` are equal. If they are, it continues expanding until they are not equal or we reach the boundaries of the string. The function then returns the length of the palindrome found.

```typescript
function expandAroundCenter(s: string, left: number, right: number): number {
		while (left >= 0 && right < s.length && s[left] === s[right]) {
				left--;
				right++;
		}

		return right - left - 1;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. In the worst case, we expand around each character, taking linear time for each character, resulting in quadratic time complexity.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as we only use a few variables to keep track of the start and end indices, and no additional data structures are used.
