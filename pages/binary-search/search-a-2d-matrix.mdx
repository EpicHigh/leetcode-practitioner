## Problem

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

## Example

Input:
matrix = [
[1, 3, 5, 7],
[10, 11, 16, 20],
[23, 30, 34, 60]
]
target = 3

Output: true

## Summary

To solve this problem, we can treat the 2D matrix as a 1D sorted array and perform a binary search to find the target value. We can convert the 1D index to 2D row and column indices using simple arithmetic operations.

## Solution

### In TypeScript

```typescript
function searchMatrix(matrix: number[][], target: number): boolean {
    const rows = matrix.length;
    const cols = matrix[0].length;

    let left = 0;
    let right = rows * cols - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        const midValue = matrix[Math.floor(mid / cols)][mid % cols];

        if (midValue === target) {
            return true;
        } else if (midValue < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```

### In Python

```python
def searchMatrix(matrix, target):
		rows = len(matrix)
		cols = len(matrix[0])

		left = 0
		right = rows * cols - 1

		while left <= right:
				mid = (left + right) // 2
				midValue = matrix[mid // cols][mid % cols]

				if midValue == target:
						return True
				elif midValue < target:
						left = mid + 1
				else:
						right = mid - 1

		return False
```

## Step-by-step explanation

1. Determine the number of rows and columns in the matrix.

```typescript
const rows = matrix.length;
const cols = matrix[0].length;
```

2. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the start and end indices of the "flattened" matrix (if it were a 1D array).

```typescript
let left = 0;
let right = rows * cols - 1;
```

3. Perform a binary search in the matrix, as if it was a 1D sorted array.

```typescript
while (left <= right) {
    // Find the middle index in the "flattened" matrix
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

    // Convert the 1D mid index to 2D row and column indices
    const row = Math.floor(mid / cols);
    const col = mid % cols;

    // Get the value at the calculated 2D indices
    const midValue = matrix[row][col];

    // If the midValue is equal to the target, return true
    if (midValue === target) {
        return true;
    }
    // If the midValue is less than the target, update the left pointer to mid + 1
    else if (midValue < target) {
        left = mid + 1;
    }
    // If the midValue is greater than the target, update the right pointer to mid - 1
    else {
        right = mid - 1;
    }
}
```

4. If the binary search loop ends without finding the target value, return false.

```typescript
return false;
```

By treating the 2D matrix as a 1D sorted array and using binary search, we can efficiently search for the target value in the matrix.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(log(m * n)), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we perform a binary search over the elements of the matrix, which takes logarithmic time in the total number of elements.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional space to store the row and column indices and the calculated mid value.
