# Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive resource for those looking to improve their coding skills and prepare for technical interviews. This resource is designed to help you master coding by providing problems from popular coding platforms, with detailed explanations and a search function to help you easily find the information you need. Our goal is to help you become a more confident and skilled developer, capable of tackling any coding challenge with ease.

I have compiled a collection of solved problems from the popular coding platform LeetCode, implemented in TypeScript, Python and other languages in the future, and tried to provide detailed explanations for each solution. I have also included a search function to help you quickly find the problems and solutions you are looking for.

This website is organised and inspired by [GRIND 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75).

I hope that this website will be a valuable resource for you as you practice and improve your coding abilities. Happy coding!"

# What is LeetCode?

LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. It contains hundreds of problems that are categorized by difficulty and topic. The problems are designed to be solved in a variety of programming languages, including TypeScript and Python. The problems are also designed to be solved in a variety of time and space complexities.
