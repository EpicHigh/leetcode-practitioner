# Introduction

Welcome to our JavaScript LeetCode practices documentation website! This website is a comprehensive resource for those looking to improve your coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

I have compiled a collection of solved problems from the popular coding platform LeetCode, implemented in JavaScript and other languages in the future, and tried to provide detailed explanations for each solution. I have also included a search function to help you quickly find the problems and solutions you are looking for.

I hope that this website will be a valuable resource for you as you practice and improve your coding abilities. Happy coding!"
