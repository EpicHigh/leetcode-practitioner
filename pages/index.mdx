# Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive resource for those looking to improve their coding skills and prepare for technical interviews. This resource is designed to help you master coding by providing problems from popular coding platforms, with detailed explanations and a search function to help you easily find the information you need. Our goal is to help you become a more confident and skilled developer, capable of tackling any coding challenge with ease. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics of coding or an experienced developer looking to take your skills to the next level, it has something for you.

Have you ever struggled with LeetCode problems during job interviews? Well, fear not, because I have created a website that reviews those tricky questions and helps you ace your interviews! I actually started this website for my own benefit, but soon realized that others could benefit from it as well. That's why I decided to make it available to the public. So, if you want to boost your coding skills and increase your chances of landing your dream job.

I have compiled a collection of solved problems from the popular coding platform LeetCode, implemented in TypeScript, Python and other languages in the future, and tried to provide detailed explanations for each solution. I have also included a search function to help you quickly find the problems and solutions you are looking for.

This website is organised and inspired by [GRIND 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75).

I hope that this website will be a valuable resource for you as you practice and improve your coding abilities. Happy coding!"

# What is LeetCode?
