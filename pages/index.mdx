# Introduction

Welcome to my JavaScript LeetCode practices documentation website! This website is a comprehensive resource for those looking to improve your coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

I have compiled a collection of solved problems from the popular coding platform LeetCode, implemented in TypeScript, Python and other languages in the future, and tried to provide detailed explanations for each solution. I have also included a search function to help you quickly find the problems and solutions you are looking for.

This website is organised and inspired by the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice). The problems are categorised into different topics and subtopics. Each topic has a list of problems, and each problem has a list of solutions. Each solution has a detailed explanation and a link to the LeetCode problem page.

I hope that this website will be a valuable resource for you as you practice and improve your coding abilities. Happy coding!"

# What is LeetCode?

LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. It contains hundreds of problems that are categorized by difficulty and topic. The problems are designed to be solved in a variety of programming languages, including TypeScript and Python. The problems are also designed to be solved in a variety of time and space complexities.
