## Problem

Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

## Example

Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"

Output: true

## Summary

To solve this problem, we can use two pointers that move through the strings s and t from the end to the beginning, skipping characters that have been deleted by the backspace key (#). When the pointers reach valid characters, we compare them, and if they are different, we return false. If the comparison finishes without finding differences, we return true.

## Solution

### In TypeScript

```typescript
function backspaceCompare(s: string, t: string): boolean {
	let p1 = s.length - 1;
	let p2 = t.length - 1;

	while (p1 >= 0 || p2 >= 0) {
		let sBackspaces = 0;
		let tBackspaces = 0;

		while (p1 >= 0 && (s[p1] === '#' || sBackspaces > 0)) {
			s[p1] === '#' ? sBackspaces++ : sBackspaces--;
			p1--;
		}

		while (p2 >= 0 && (t[p2] === '#' || tBackspaces > 0)) {
			t[p2] === '#' ? tBackspaces++ : tBackspaces--;
			p2--;
		}

		if (p1 >= 0 && p2 >= 0 && s[p1] !== t[p2]) {
			return false;
		}

		if ((p1 >= 0) !== (p2 >= 0)) {
			return false;
		}

		p1--;
		p2--;
	}

	return true;
}
```

### In Python

```python
def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
	p1 = len(s) - 1
	p2 = len(t) - 1

	while p1 >= 0 or p2 >= 0:
		s_backspaces = 0
		t_backspaces = 0

		while p1 >= 0 and (s[p1] == '#' or s_backspaces > 0):
			s_backspaces += 1 if s[p1] == '#' else -1
			p1 -= 1

		while p2 >= 0 and (t[p2] == '#' or t_backspaces > 0):
			t_backspaces += 1 if t[p2] == '#' else -1
			p2 -= 1

		if p1 >= 0 and p2 >= 0 and s[p1] != t[p2]:
			return False

		if (p1 >= 0) != (p2 >= 0):
			return False

		p1 -= 1
		p2 -= 1

	return True
```

## Step-by-step explanation

1. We initialize two pointers, `p1` and `p2`, to point at the last characters of strings `s` and `t` respectively.

```typescript
let p1 = s.length - 1;
let p2 = s.length - 1;
```

2. We start a `while` loop that continues as long as either `p1` or `p2` is greater than or equal to 0. This means we will keep iterating until both pointers have traversed the entire strings `s` and `t`.

```typescript
while (p1 >= 0 || p2 >= 0) {
	// ...
}
```

3. Within the `while` loop, we initialize two counters, `sBackspaces` and `tBackspaces`, to count the number of backspaces (`#`) encountered in `s` and `t` respectively.

```typescript
let sBackspaces = 0;
let tBackspaces = 0;
```

4. We use two nested `while` loops to move the pointers `p1` and `p2` backwards through `s` and `t` to skip characters that have been "deleted" by the backspace key (`#`). We increment the corresponding backspace counters when encountering a `#` character and decrement them when we find a regular character that is "deleted" by a backspace.


```typescript
while (p1 >= 0 && (S[p1] === '#' || sBackspaces > 0)) {
	s[p1] === '#' ? sBackspaces++ : sBackspaces--;
	p1--;
}

while (p2 >= 0 && (T[p2] === '#' || tBackspaces > 0)) {
	t[p2] === '#' ? tBackspaces++ : tBackspaces--;
	p2--;
}
```

5. After both nested `while` loops, the pointers `p1` and `p2` should point at valid (undeleted) characters or be less than 0 (indicating the beginning of the string has been reached). We then compare the characters at `p1` and `p2`. If they are different, we return `false`, as the two strings are not equal.

```typescript
if (p1 >= 0 && p2 >= 0 && S[p1] !== T[p2]) {
	return false;
}
```

6. If only one of the pointers is greater than or equal to 0, it means one string has been fully traversed, while the other still has valid characters. In this case, we return `false`, as the strings are not equal.

```typescript
if ((p1 >= 0) !== (p2 >= 0)) {
	return false;
}
```

7. If none of the above conditions are met, we move both pointers one step backwards and continue with the next iteration of the `while` loop.

```typescript
p1--;
p2--;
```

8. If the `while` loop completes without returning `false`, it means both strings are equal after processing the backspaces. Therefore, we return `true`.

```typescript
return true;
```

By following these steps, the function `backspaceCompare` determines whether the two strings `S` and `T` are equal after simulating typing them into empty text editors, considering the backspace key (#).

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(m + n), where m is the length of string S and n is the length of string T. In the worst case, we need to traverse both strings from end to beginning once.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), as we only use constant extra space for the pointers and counters.
