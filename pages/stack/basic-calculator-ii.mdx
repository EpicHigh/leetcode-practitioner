## Problem

Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of [-231, 231 - 1].

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

## Example

Input: s = "3+2*2"

Output: 7

## Summary

To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of the numbers and their signs in the expression. We iterate through the input string and perform the following actions:

- If the current character is a digit, we accumulate the digit to form the complete number.
- If the current character is an operator or a whitespace, we perform the following actions based on the previous operator:
	- If the previous operator is a plus (`+`) or minus (`-`), we push the current number onto the stack with its sign.
	- If the previous operator is a multiplication (`*`) or division (`/`), we pop the top number from the stack, perform the operation with the current number, and push the result back onto the stack.
	- We update the previous operator with the current operator.

At the end of the iteration, we sum up the numbers on the stack to get the final result.

## Solution

### In TypeScript

```typescript
function calculate(s: string): number {
	const stack: number[] = [];
	let currentNumber = 0;
	let prevOperator = '+';

	for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
		const char = s[i];

		if (char >= '0' && char <= '9') {
			currentNumber = currentNumber * 10 + parseInt(char);
		}

		if (char === '+' || char === '-' || char === '*' || char === '/' || i === s.length - 1) {
			if (prevOperator === '+') {
				stack.push(currentNumber);
			} else if (prevOperator === '-') {
				stack.push(-currentNumber);
			} else if (prevOperator === '*') {
				stack.push(stack.pop() as number * currentNumber);
			} else if (prevOperator === '/') {
				stack.push(Math.trunc((stack.pop() as number) / currentNumber));
			}

			prevOperator = char;
			currentNumber = 0;
		}
	}

	return stack.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
}
```

### In Python

```python
def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
	stack = []
	current_number = 0
	prev_operator = '+'

	for i in range(len(s)):
		char = s[i]

		if char.isdigit():
			current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)

		if char in '+-*/' or i == len(s) - 1:
			if prev_operator == '+':
				stack.append(current_number)
			elif prev_operator == '-':
				stack.append(-current_number)
			elif prev_operator == '*':
				stack.append(stack.pop() * current_number)
			elif prev_operator == '/':
				stack.append(int(stack.pop() / current_number))

			prev_operator = char
			current_number = 0

	return sum(stack)
```

## Step-by-step explanation

1. We initialize an empty stack `stack` to keep track of the numbers and their signs in the expression, a variable `currentNumber` to accumulate digits, and a variable `prevOperator` to store the previous operator. We set `prevOperator` to `'+'` initially.

```typescript
const stack: number[] = [];
let currentNumber = 0;
let prevOperator = '+';
```

2. We start a `for` loop that iterates through each character in the input string `s`.

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
	// ...
}
```

3. Inside the loop, we store the current character in the variable `char`.

```typescript
const char = s[i];
```

4. If the current character is a digit, we accumulate the digit in `currentNumber`. We multiply the current value of `currentNumber` by 10 and add the integer value of the current character.

```typescript
if (char >= '0' && char <= '9') {
	currentNumber = currentNumber * 10 + parseInt(char);
}
```

5. If the current character is an operator or a whitespace, or if we have reached the end of the input string, we perform the following actions based on the previous operator:

```typescript
if (char === '+' || char === '-' || char === '*' || char === '/' || i === s.length - 1) {
	// ...
}
```

a. If the previous operator is a plus (`+`), we push the current number onto the stack.

```typescript
if (prevOperator === '+') {
	stack.push(currentNumber);
}
```

b. If the previous operator is a minus (`-`), we push the current number with a negative sign onto the stack.

```typescript
else if (prevOperator === '-') {
	stack.push(-currentNumber);
}
```

c. If the previous operator is a multiplication (`*`), we pop the top number from the stack, multiply it with the current number, and push the result back onto the stack.

```typescript
else if (prevOperator === '*') {
	stack.push(stack.pop() as number * currentNumber);
}
```

d. If the previous operator is a division (`/`), we pop the top number from the stack, divide it by the current number, truncate the result towards zero using `Math.trunc`, and push the result back onto the stack.

```typescript
else if (prevOperator === '/') {
	stack.push(Math.trunc((stack.pop() as number) / currentNumber));
}
```

6. After performing the appropriate action based on the previous operator, we update the `prevOperator` with the current operator and reset `currentNumber` to 0.

```typescript
prevOperator = char;
currentNumber = 0;
```

7. After iterating through all characters in the input string, the stack contains the numbers and their signs in the expression. We use the `reduce` function to sum up the numbers on the stack and return the result.

```typescript
return stack.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We iterate through the input string once, performing operations based on the current character and updating the stack.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), as we use a stack to store the numbers and their signs in the expression. In the worst case, we might have to store n/2 numbers in the stack, where n is the length of the input string.
